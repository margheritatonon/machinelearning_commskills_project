# Machine Learning and Communication Skills Project: Predicting Patient Health

Predictive analysis plays a critical role in early detection and prevention of diseases. Medical history and lifestyle habits are driving factors in health outcomes; however, the extent to which each risk factor weighs in on illnesses is harder to determine. Predicting patient risk can help ensure long-term patient health, reduce costs by avoiding expensive medical tests, and allow more effective time allocation of medical professionals.

Machine learning methods are increasingly used for analyzing healthcare datasets. Applications include diagnosing diseases, predicting treatment responses, and assessing risk factors. Nonetheless, models can lack accuracy due to biased datasets and inadequate algorithm choices.

The objective of this study is to predict whether an individual is likely to be healthy or unhealthy based on various lifestyle factors. The outcomes of this study could advance predictive models in healthcare, aiding in preventive medical care. Identifying which risk factors are the most likely to reduce health could be used in educational campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles, shifting the focus to disease prevention rather than disease treatment.
